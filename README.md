# Cortex-Idler
Idle Cortex games

Edit games.txt so that each game you want to idle uses 3 lines of text at a time. Put the full path (without the trailing \ at the end of the path). On the next line, put the filename of the game OR the launcher (without the .exe extention). On the last line, enter the earn rate value for the zSilver. It should look something like this for each game...

C:\Path\To\Game\Directory
gamefilename
1

You can put up to 10 games in that format. Lines 1 is ignored. Do not put any in line 1 of the text file. Anything on line 32 down will be ignored also. You can put the values of games that are not featured this month in case they become featured another month. 

If you do not have 10 games, make sure to put SKIP instead of the filenames. This will tell the program not to include them in the calculations and will skip those lines. The following are the lines to SKIP:
Line 6
Line 9
Line 12
Line 15
Line 18
Line 21
Line 24
Line 27
Line 30
